# rust-os

This repository contains code that serves as a starting point for building an operating system using Rust. The implementation based off "OS Development Series" by Philipp Oppermann.

### Why did i write this kernel

 I wanted to deepen my understanding of operating systems theory, and in the meanwhile, I had become increasingly interested in exploring Rust as a language, particularly its potential for improving memory safety and reducing runtime overhead in low-level programming tasks such as OS development.
 
 
  When I discovered the Os Rust Dev project, I thought it could be interesting to combine these subjects into one cohesive effort.
